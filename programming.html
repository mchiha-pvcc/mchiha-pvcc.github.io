        <ul>
            <li> Sequential structure:Top-down execution </li>
            <li> Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
            <li> Iterative (looping):</li>    
            <ol>
                <li> While loop: continue looping as long something is true.</li>
                <li> repeat/ until loop: continue looping until something is true.</li>
                <li> for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
            </ol>
            <li> Recursive structures:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself.</li>
                <li>Repetition continues until:
                    <ul>
                        <li> degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met
                            (degenerative case is also called a "base case")
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <h1> Two Classic programming/database problems</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> Sorting:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Descending order/ Ascending order</li>
                <li>Sorting numbers</li>
                <li> Sorting strings (in accordace with ASCII values)</li>
            </ul>
            <li> Searching:</li>
            <ul> 
                <li> find specific data that meet a certain criteria</li>
                <li> In database:</li>
                <ol> 
                    <li> Filters: temporary search</li>
                    <li> Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated </li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
        </ol>
<h1> Two popular search techniques:</h1>
<ol>
    <li> Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
    <li> Binary search:</li>
    <ul> 
        <li> only works if data is SORTED first.</li>
        <li> Start in the midle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<h1> Two Classic program goals:</h1>
<ol>
    <li> Efficiency: program takes minimal tme and/or resources</li>
    <li> Correctness: program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions. </li>
</ol>
<h1>Software testing and verfication</h1>

<h1>Software testing is done to detect:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Architectural flaws.</li>
    <li> Poor design decisions.</li>
    <li> Invalid or incorrect functionality.</li>
    <li> Security vulnerabilities functionality.</li>
    <li> scalability issues.</li>
</ol> 
<h1>Testing best practices:</h1>
<ol>
    <li> Continous testing:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Project teams test each build as it becomes available. </li>
        <li>This type of software testing relies on test automation that is integrated with the deployment process. </li>
        <li>It enables software to be validated in realistic test environments earlier in the process-improving design and reducing risks. </li>
    </ul> 
    <li> Configuration management:</li>
    <ul> 
        <li>Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test </li>
        <li>Teams gain access to assets such as code, requirements, design documents, models, test scripts and test results.  </li>
        <li>Good systems include user authentication and audit trails to help teams meet compliance requirements with minimal administrative effort.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Service virtualization:</li>
    <ul> 
        <li> Testing environments may not be available, especially early in code development. </li>
        <li> Service virtualization simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner. </li>
        <li> They can reuse, deploy and change a configuration to test different scenarios without having to modify the original environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Defect or bug tracking:</li>
    <ul> 
        <li>Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality. </li>
        <li>  Automated tools allow teams to track defects, measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Metrics and reporting: </li>
    <ul> 
        <li> Reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results.</li>
        <li> Advanced tools integrate project metrics and present results in a dashboard.</li>
        <li> Teams quickly see the overall health of a project and can monitor relationships between test, development and other project elements.</li>
    </ul>
